# jquery-raptorize
Based on ZURB's jQuery raptorize plugin, updated to work with jQuery 2, produce less messy HTML, and be able to use the konami code multiple times

This 'inline' branch is usefull when you're trying to sneak in the raptorize plugin. You only need this concatenated version of the raptorize.js file. No raptor.png, raptor-sound.mp3, or raptor-sound.ogg.
